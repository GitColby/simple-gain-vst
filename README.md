Let me know if you'd like me to:

- Turn this into a `.md` or `.pdf` file for upload
- Add a “How to Use” section for users in DAWs
- Draft a professional LinkedIn post to promote the release

Want a version with badges too (e.g. “Built with JUCE”, “MIT License”, “First Plugin”)? I can add those as well.
